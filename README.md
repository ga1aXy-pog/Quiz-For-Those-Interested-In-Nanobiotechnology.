# Quiz-For-Those-Interested-In-Nanobiotechnology.
This program system showcases basic python learning, and showcases how nanobiotechnology works at a general perspective. This program acts like a escape box digitally!


A general quiz that can be used for the improvement of nanobiotechnology.

The code has currently not finished, and it is still under development to this date (the code has been completed to the most basic level)!


One of my first ever projects with just the beginning of programming and computer science knowledge! This program has been made by me at 12 years old.
